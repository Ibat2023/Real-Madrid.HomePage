	<h3>The Future of Santiago Bernabeu</h3>
		<p><b>The Santiago Bernabeu</b> is set to undergo a facelift which will ensure that the arena continues to be a global benchmark within the worlds of sport and architecture. According to 
		 <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/history/presidents/florentino-perez" title="Florentino Perez"> Florentino Perez,</a> 
		"The new stadium will continue to be the setting that generates the emotions which will leave their mark on Real Madrid's future.</a></p>
	<h3>About the project</h3>
		<p>The joint project led by <a href="https://www.gmp.de/en/projects/652/estadio-santiago-bernabeu-madrid" title="GMP Arquitectos">GMP Arquitectos</a>
	and <b>L35 Ribas</b> successfully secured the tender to oversee a revamp of a stadium that is poised to become a global role model. The renovation work will see the Bernabéu become a state-of-the-art arena that satisfies the demands of club members, whilst also increasing the club's revenue streams. One standout feature will be the stadium's wrap-around facade, which will consist of strips of steel and stripes which can be lit up and upon which images can be projected. The new arena will also offer the option for the pitch to be covered by both permanent and retractable roofs, a feature which will ensure that all of the seating areas are covered. </p>
	<h3>Completition date of Santiago Bernabeu redevelopment</h3>
		<p><b>Real Madrid's </b> famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab%C3%A9u_Stadium" title="Santiago Bernabeu stadium">Santiago Bernabeu stadium</a>
		will not be completely redeveloped until the start of the 2023/24 season at the earliest due to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
		The Bernabeu is currently undergoing a €525m facelift that will see the iconic arena gain a slight capacity increase and fitted with a retractable roof among other modern features.
		It had been hoped that work would be finished in time to celebrate the stadium's 75th anniversary in December, but AS report that Real Madrid have accepted that the earliest possible re-opening will be for the start of the 2023/24 campaign. They are struggling to bring in the required materials in part due to Russia's presence in Ukraine.</a></p>
